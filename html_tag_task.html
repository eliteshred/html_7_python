        <h1><hr>Lets talk about career today<hr></h1>
        <h2>Career for Women</h2>

        <p> I think womens need to take their career seriously, not to show anybody but for themelves.  I don't want to talk abaout <i> women empowerment</i> and <br> all 
        as people get irrited by this word easily nowdays.</p>
        <strong> I think women need to take career seriously for this reason</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Self independent as being dependent on someone is not good idea in this cruel world.</li>
        <li>For respect, I dont think any person who is not earning are getting respect in world, Look at our <del>housewife</del> homemaker mother, do you think <br> they 
        are getting respect like a jobworker.</li>
        </ul>
        I know every women has a choice of to work or not and it's up to them to work or not, I am not demeaning any women who choose to be homemaker <br> but what if the
        person who is providing you die, or cheated on you or your marriage doesn't work for any reason. 
        <br>There is Ted talk of  <u>Sharon Beldon</u> below is link which tell you best to take decision.
